:::::::::::::::TYPES OF TUNNELING
Duel Stack: networks using both ipv4 and ipv6; not interchangably 
6 in 4: 
6 to 4: gateways encapsulate ipv6 packets withen ipv4
4 to 6: 
teredo: RFC 4380; Allows ipv4 clients to access ipv6 clients; commonly used behind nats
ISATAP: used for internal networks
:::::::::::::::COVERT CHANNELS 
transfering of data with ligetiment protocols to tranfer data in inlegitaemet ways; [usually icmp, dsn, http] ;; messages over ICMP.
     TYPES:
        .STORAGE 
            PAYLOAD
            HEADER; tcp and ip header( takes longer because header is a set size) 
        .TIMING
            modifying legit traffic
            delaying packets
            watch ttl change
