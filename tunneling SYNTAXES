::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::TYPES OF TUNNELING
Duel Stack: networks using both ipv4 and ipv6; not interchangably 
6 in 4: 
6 to 4: gateways encapsulate ipv6 packets withen ipv4
4 to 6: 
teredo: RFC 4380; Allows ipv4 clients to access ipv6 clients; commonly used behind nats
ISATAP: used for internal networks
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::COVERT CHANNELS 
transfering of data with ligetiment protocols to tranfer data in inlegitaemet ways; [usually icmp, dsn, http] ;; messages over ICMP.
     TYPES:
        .STORAGE 
            PAYLOAD
            HEADER; tcp and ip header( takes longer because header is a set size) 
        .TIMING
            modifying legit traffic
            delaying packets
            watch ttl change

               ( KEYS )
     user-assymetric used to indentify user to the server
    host- asymmetric public used to identify the host to the server
    session- symmetric created by the client in the server

       
               (config files)
                  .client conf file (/etssh/ssh_config)
 
                  .server conf file (/etc/ssh/sshd_conf)
 
                  .known host file  (~/.ssh/known_host) conatins sha256 fingerprint for host key



                                                                                                         'PORT FORWARDING' 


 .SSH OPTIONS
     -L OPENING PORT ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE                                                                 -L AND -R DETERMIN THE POV YOU ARE WORKING FROM
     -R OPENING PORT ON REMOTE MACHINE THAT CONNECTS BACK TO YOU
     -D SOCKS4 PROXY TUNNEL WHERE TARGET IP:PORT IS SPECCIFIED DYNAMICALLY 
     -NT USED AFTER TUNNEL IS SET, MEANS "DO NOT EXECUTE A REMOTE COMMAND AND DIASBLE PSEUDO-TTY".


 .LOCAL PORT FORWARDING SYNTAX 
           SSH -P <ALT CLIENT SSH PORT> <USER@SERVER IP> -L <LOCAL PORT>:TGTIP:TGTPORT -NT 
                  <ON MY COMPUTER                           <ON MY COMP>:     :VULNURABLE PORT, 22, 80
      
                        .ONCE THIS TUNNEL IS SET,
                              SSH <TGTUSER@127.0.0.1 -P 1111 -D 9050 -NT
                        .FOR HTTP WE CAN USE THIS TO GET THE WEBPAGE INFO
                              WGET -R HTTP://127.0.0.1:LPORT         

      DYNAMIC TUNNELS
ONLY ONE DYNAMIC TUNNEL MA BE USED AT A TIME  
     -PROXYCHAINS IS THE COMMAND USED IN ORDER TO FORWRD COMMANDS TO THE TARGET DEVICE 
.REMOTE PORT FORWAERD SYNTAX
    FROM THE REDER 
          SSH <USER>@<IP> -R <PORT>:<IP>:<PORT>
              <ME@MYCOMP>   <PORT I WANT OPEN MY COMP>:<IP OF TGT>:<PORT WE WANT TO GIVE OURSELVES ACCESS TO>              


BIH$ TELNET 10.50.87.199  ( because SSH was off on rick)
RICK$ ip a  (find other ips to access )
rick$ ssh student@ IH float ip -R 1111:localhost:22 -NT  ( set up a reverse port because even tho rick is clocking ssh, that doesnt mean we are )
BIH$ ssh Rick@localhost -p 1111 -D 9050 -NT ( sets up the connection for us to forward our commands using proxychain)
new term BIH$ ssh Rick@localhost -p 1111 -L 2222:second ip we found:22 -NT (sets up a local forward to the new ip using the connection we have to our rick ip)
